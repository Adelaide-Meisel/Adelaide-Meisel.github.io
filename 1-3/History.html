<h1>History</h1>

Brewed Awakening was created in 2006 by Anna Shvets. Her love of chocolate and sweets mixed with passion made this compony possible. She started making sweets and selling them at 
bake fairs and continued through funding to create the local buisness, Brewed Awakening. Thank you for supporting local buisnesses through donations.

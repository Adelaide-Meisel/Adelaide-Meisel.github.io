    I am a highschool student at Bay city Western with all A's and perfect attendence. 
    Extracurricualrs I've had are French and Band. I like to read, make beaded braclets, 
    and sketch. Some of my hobbies are walking and playing and flute. I code at the ISD 
    Career Center where I have met many new people from all over Michigan. After High 
    School I plan on going to Delta for 2-Years and then Oakland University for 4 years.
